# shuttle
A tensorflow API implementation for detecting shuttle cocks - ROBOCON

**Description**
  
  This project is inspired by the Robocon competioion. The task for the robot is to play a game of badmintion. This program will detect shuttlecocks by making use for the tensorflow API. The repo consists of a small dataset for the same.
