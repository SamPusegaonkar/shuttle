A tensorflow API implementation for detecting shuttle cocks - ROBOCON

 **Description**: This project is inspired by the Robocon competition. The task for the robot is to play a game of badmintion. This program will detect shuttlecocks by making use of the tensorflow API. The repo consists of a small dataset for the same.  <br/>
  
  **Required Libraries/ Pre-requisites:**:     
  
    * Please follow this fantastic guide: https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10
                     
  **Where the files belong**: 
  
    1. labelmap.pbtxt belongs in the training folder.
    2. train.record and test.record belongs in the object_detection folder.
    3. images folder belongs inside the object_detection folder.
    4. move the csv files into the images folder
